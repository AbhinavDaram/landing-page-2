                            <p>January 2024 - April 2024</p>
                            <p>This was done at the Controls Department Lead on FRC 8728, Troy Argonauts for the 2024
                                FRC Season: Crescendo. Under this role, I led all the members of the controls subgroup,
                                giving out projects to students who needed as well as program the bot as well. Under
                                this role I also experimented with datalogging, which allowed me to log important
                                information such as the amount of power drawn by a motor which can be used to solve
                                potential issues. In fact, this was used to identify a major issue where we found out
                                the robot was underperforming, allowing us to put current limits so that it would
                                perform as intended. All programming work, from sensors to main subsystems where checked
                                and edited by me as well as some were written by me last second during competitions to
                                make sure everything was running smoothly and any previous issues would be resolved. I
                                was also a member of the drive team for this robot, under the operator role where I
                                would control all the subsystems other than the chassis. I controlled the arm,
                                maniuplator, and climber. Alongside this I was also assisting with any fabrication or
                                electrical tasks assisting with building subsystems or wiring them up to the robot. </p>

                                Season: Charged Up. With my heightened role, I was able to lead certain projects
                                regrading programming such as the vision processing team, where we would use a camera
                                called a limelight, that would shoot a green light at retroreflective tape or scan april
                                tags and figure out where on the field it is. We also attached a Google Coral to it and
                                allowed it to identify the game pieces. I also was fabrication project lead and had
                                worked on parts of the robot, whether it be simple fixes or taking apart whole
                                subsystems and remaking them and rewiring them back up. I also did electrical work on
                                the robot, assisting when needed. </p>

                                with building an arm that can be used to climb bars that were set up on the playing
                                field. An integral part of the robot, sometimes some matches were decided by whether we
                                could climb the monkey bars or not. </p>
